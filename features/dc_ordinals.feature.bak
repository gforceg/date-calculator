Feature: The date cruncher should evaluate ordinal expressions.

  As a user, I want to be able to evaluate expressions such as "The 3rd Thursday in November", and "The last Friday in January of 2017"

  Scenario: The user wants to evaluate "the last Friday in December 2016"
    Given I evaluate "The last Friday in December 2016" as "the solution"
    Then "the solution" must equal "12/30/2016"
